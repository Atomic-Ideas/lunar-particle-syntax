Lunar Particle Syntax Theme
=========
This is a dark theme with universe emphasize!

Description
----------------
This syntax theme was created to emphasize the graphics effects of Lunar Particle UI Theme. I love dark sunburst background and the One Dark
themes, so you will find a lot of these themes here, but with my changes and preferences. Actually I get what I love from sunburst syntax theme
to create a new set of syntax colors.

**For a better experience use it with Lunar Particle UI**

Installation
------------

### By terminal:

* apm install lunar-particle-syntax
* or search it from atom's settings console

Preview
